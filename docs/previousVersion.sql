Titles should be descriptive, but not very long.\r\n\r\n<b>Meta Tags</b>\r\nMeta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page. There is a great site called <a href=\"http://www.metatagbuilder.com/\">Meta Tag Builder</a> that will help you build meta tags if you\'ve never done it before.\r\n\r\n<i>Advanced Users:</i> If you have other things (like JavaScript) you usually put in the &lt;head&gt; area of your pages, you may put them here as well.','0');

If you are unhappy with the url that was chosen, you can change it here.\r\n\r\n<b>Owner</b>\r\nThe owner of a page is usually the person who created the page. If you\'d like to give ownership of a page to a different content manager, then change the name here. Be careful though, once you change ownership of the page, you won\'t be able to get it back unless you are an administrator.\r\n\r\n<b>Owner can view?</b>\r\nCan the owner view the page or not?\r\n\r\n<b>Owner can edit?</b>\r\nCan the owner edit the page or not? Be careful, if you decide that the owner cannot edit the page and you do not belong to the page group, then you\'ll lose the ability to edit this page.\r\n\r\n<b>Group</b>\r\nA group is assigned to every page for additional privilege control.

If it can be done, this user has the rights to do it.\r\n\r\n<b>Visitor</b>\r\nVisitor is exactly the opposite of Admin. Visitor has no rights what-so-ever.

You could have some pages that look like your company\'s brochure, and some pages that look like Yahoo!. You could even have some pages that look like pages in a book. Using style management, you have ultimate control over all your designs.\r\n\r\nThere are three styles built in to WebGUI: Fail Safe, Plain Black Software, and Yahoo!. These styles are not meant to be edited, but rather to give you samples of what\'s possible.\r\n\r\n<b>Fail Safe</b>\r\nWhen you delete a style that is still in use on some pages, the Fail Safe style will be applied to those pages. This style has a white background and simple navigation.\r\n\r\n<b>Plain Black Software</b>\r\nThis is the simple design used on the Plain Black Software site.\r\n\r\n<b>Yahoo!</b>\r\nThis is the design of the Yahoo! site.

They are Admins, Content Managers, Visitors, and Registered Users.\r\n\r\n<b>Admins</b>\r\nAdmins are users who have unlimited privileges within WebGUI. A user should only be added to the admin group if they oversee the system. Usually only one to three people will be added to this group.\r\n\r\n<b>Content Managers</b>\r\nContent managers are users who have privileges to add, edit, and delete content from various areas on the site. The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but instead just whether users can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.\r\n\r\n<b>Registered Users</b>\r\nWhen users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.\r\n\r\n<b>Visitors</b>\r\nVisitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system.

INSERT INTO help VALUES (20,'US English','Add','SQL Report','SQL Reports are perhaps the most powerful widget in the WebGUI arsenal. They allow a user to query data from any database that they have access to. This is great for getting sales figures from your Accounting database or even summarizing all the message boards on your web site.\r\n\r\n<b>Title</b>\r\nThe title of this report.\r\n\r\n<b>Display Title?</b>\r\nDo you wish to display the title of the report? If so, check the box.\r\n\r\n<b>Process Macros</b>\r\nDo you wish to process WebGUI Macros on this report? If so, check the box.\r\n\r\n<b>Description</b>\r\nDescribe the content of this report so your users will better understand what the report is all about.\r\n\r\n<b>Template</b>\r\nLayout a template of how this report should look. Usually you\'ll use HTML tables to generate a report. An example is included below.\r\n\r\nThere are 11 special macro characters used in generating SQL Reports. They are ^-, ^0, ^1, ^2, ^3, ^4, ^5, ^6, ^7, ^8, and ^9. These macros will be processed regardless of whether you checked the process macros box above. The ^- macro represents split points in the document where the report will begin and end looping. The numeric macros represent the data fields that will be returned from your query. Note that you may only have 10 fields returned per row in your query.\r\n\r\n<i>Sample Template:</i>\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Employee Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Employee #&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Vacation Days Remaining&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Monthly Salary&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n^-\r\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;^0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;^1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;^2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;^3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n^-\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n<b>Query</b>\r\nThis is a standard SQL query. If you are unfamiliar with SQL, <a href=\"http://www.plainblack.com\">Plain Black Software</a> provides training courses in SQL and database management.\r\n\r\n<b>DSN</b>\r\n<b>D</b>ata <b>S</b>ource <b>N</b>ame is the unique identifier that Perl uses to describe the location of your database. It takes the format of DBI:[driver]:[database name]:[host]. \r\n\r\n<i>Example:</i> DBI:mysql:WebGUI:localhost\r\n\r\n<b>Database User</b>\r\nThe username you use to connect to the DSN.\r\n\r\n<b>Database Password</b>\r\nThe password you use to connect to the DSN.\r\n','19');
