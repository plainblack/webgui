For instance, if you want to write a letter to the editor of your favorite magazine you\'d get out a notepad (or open a word processor) and start filling it with your thoughts. The same is true with WebGUI. Create a page, then add your content to the page.\r\n\r\n<b>Title</b>\r\nThe title of the page is what your users will use to navigate through the site. Titles should be descriptive, but not very long.\r\n\r\n<b>Meta Tags</b>\r\nMeta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page. There is a great site called <a href=\"http://www.metatagbuilder.com/\">Meta Tag Builder</a> that will help you build meta tags if you\'ve never done it before.\r\n\r\n<i>Advanced Users:</i> If you have other things (like JavaScript) you usually put in the &lt;head&gt; area of your pages, you may put them here as well.','0');

One of those traits is style. Choose from the list of styles if you would like to change the appearance of this page. See <i>Add Style</i> for more details.\r\n\r\nIf you check the box next to the style pull-down menu, all of the pages below this page will take on the style you\'ve chosen for this page.\r\n\r\n<b>Page URL</b>\r\nWhen you create a page a url for the page is generated based on the page title. If you are unhappy with the url that was chosen, you can change it here.\r\n\r\n<b>Owner</b>\r\nThe owner of a page is usually the person who created the page. If you\'d like to give ownership of a page to a different content manager, then change the name here. Be careful though, once you change ownership of the page, you won\'t be able to get it back unless you are an administrator.\r\n\r\n<b>Owner can view?</b>\r\nCan the owner view the page or not?\r\n\r\n<b>Owner can edit?</b>\r\nCan the owner edit the page or not? Be careful, if you decide that the owner cannot edit the page and you do not belong to the page group, then you\'ll lose the ability to edit this page.\r\n\r\n<b>Group</b>\r\nA group is assigned to every page for additional privilege control. Pick a group from the pull-down menu.\r\n\r\n<b>Group can view?</b>\r\nCan members of this group view this page?\r\n\r\n<b>Group can edit?</b>\r\nCan members of this group edit this page?\r\n\r\n<b>Anybody can view?</b>\r\nCan any visitor or member regardless of the group and owner view this page?\r\n\r\n<b>Anybody can edit?</b>\r\nCan any visitor or member regardless of the group and owner edit this page?\r\n\r\n','9');

Be certain that you have already moved all the content you wish to keep before you delete a page.\r\n\r\nAs with any delete operation, you are prompted to be sure you wish to proceed with the delete.

Sometimes called a handle, it is also how the user will be known on the site. (<i>Note:</i> Administrators have unlimited power in the WebGUI system. This also means they are capable of breaking the system. If you rename or create a user, be careful not to use a username already in existance.)\r\n\r\n<b>Password</b>\r\nA password is used to ensure that the user is who s/he says s/he is.\r\n\r\n<b>Authentication Method</b>\r\nSee <i>Edit Settings</i> for details.\r\n\r\n<b>LDAP URL</b>\r\nSee <i>Edit Settings</i> for details.\r\n\r\n<b>Connect DN</b>\r\nThe Connect DN is the <b>cn</b> (or common name) of a given user in your LDAP database. It should be specified as <b>cn=John Doe</b>. This is, in effect, the username that will be used to authenticate this user against your LDAP server.\r\n\r\n<b>Email Address</b>\r\nThe user\'s email address. This must only be specified if the user will partake in functions that require email.\r\n\r\n<b>ICQ UIN</b>\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.icq.com\">ICQ</a> UIN is the \"User ID Number\" on the ICQ network. ICQ is a very popular instant messaging platform.\r\n\r\n<b>Groups</b>\r\nGroups displays which groups the user is in. Groups that are highlighted are groups that the user is assigned to.

If you truely wish to delete a user, then please keep in mind that there are consequences. If you delete a user any content that they added to the site via widgets (like message boards and user contributions) will remain on the site. However, if another user tries to visit the deleted user\'s profile they will get an error message. Also if the user ever is welcomed back to the site, there is no way to give him/her access to his/her old content items except by re-adding the user to the users table manually.\r\nAs with any delete operation, you are prompted to be sure you wish to proceed with the delete.

There are two default users built into the system: Admin and Visitor.\r\n\r\n<b>Admin</b>\r\nAdmin is exactly what you\'d expect. It is a user with unlimited rights in the WebGUI environment. If it can be done, this user has the rights to do it.\r\n\r\n<b>Visitor</b>\r\nVisitor is exactly the opposite of Admin. Visitor has no rights what-so-ever. By default any user who is not logged in is seen as the user Visitor.','0');
INSERT INTO help VALUES (9,'US English','Manage','Style','Styles are used to manage the look and feel of your WebGUI pages. With WebGUI, you can have an unlimited number of styles, so your site can take on as many looks as you like. You could have some pages that look like your company\'s brochure, and some pages that look like Yahoo!&reg;. You could even have some pages that look like pages in a book. Using style management, you have ultimate control over all your designs.\r\n\r\nThere are three styles built in to WebGUI: Fail Safe, Plain Black Software, and Yahoo!&reg;. These styles are not meant to be edited, but rather to give you samples of what\'s possible.\r\n\r\n<b>Fail Safe</b>\r\nWhen you delete a style that is still in use on some pages, the Fail Safe style will be applied to those pages. This style has a white background and simple navigation.\r\n\r\n<b>Plain Black Software</b>\r\nThis is the simple design used on the Plain Black Software site.\r\n\r\n<b>Yahoo!&reg;</b>\r\nThis is the design of the Yahoo!&reg; site. (Yahoo!&reg; has not given us permission to use their design. It is simply an example.)','0');
INSERT INTO help VALUES (10,'US English','Manage','Group','Groups are used to subdivide privileges and responsibilities within the WebGUI system. For instance, you may be building a site for a classroom situation. In that case you might set up a different group for each class that you teach. You would then apply those groups to the pages that are designed for each class.\r\n\r\nThere are four groups built into WebGUI. They are Admins, Content Managers, Visitors, and Registered Users.\r\n\r\n<b>Admins</b>\r\nAdmins are users who have unlimited privileges within WebGUI. A user should only be added to the admin group if they oversee the system. Usually only one to three people will be added to this group.\r\n\r\n<b>Content Managers</b>\r\nContent managers are users who have privileges to add, edit, and delete content from various areas on the site. The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.\r\n\r\n<b>Registered Users</b>\r\nWhen users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.\r\n\r\n<b>Visitors</b>\r\nVisitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system. Also, if you wish to punish a registered user you could remove him/her from the Registered Users group and insert him/her into the Visitors group.','0');

INSERT INTO help VALUES (12,'US English','Edit','Settings','Settings are items that allow you to adjust WebGUI to your particular needs.\r\n\r\n<b>Path to WebGUI Extras</b>\r\nThe web-path to the directory containing WebGUI images and javascript files.\r\n\r\n<b>Maximum Attachment Size</b>\r\nThe maximum size of files allowed to be uploaded to this site. This applies to all widgets that allow uploaded files and images (like Article and User Contributions). This size is measured in kilobytes.\r\n\r\n<b>Web Attachment Path</b>\r\nThe web-path of the directory where attachments are to be stored.\r\n\r\n<b>Server Attachment Path</b>\r\nThe local path of the directory where attachments are to be stored. (Perhaps /var/www/public/uploads) Be sure that the web server has the rights to write to that directory.\r\n\r\n<b>Company Name</b>\r\nThe name of your company. It will appear on all emails and anywhere you use the Company Name macro.\r\n\r\n<b>Company Email Address</b>\r\nA general email address at your company. This is the address that all automated messages will come from. It can also be used via the WebGUI macro system.\r\n\r\n<b>Company URL</b>\r\nThe primary URL of your company. This will appear on all automated emails sent from the WebGUI system. It is also available via the WebGUI macro system.\r\n\r\n<b>Authentication Method (default)</b>\r\nWhat should the default authentication method be for new accounts that are created? The two available options are WebGUI and LDAP. WebGUI authentication means that the users will authenticate against the username and password stored in the WebGUI database. LDAP authentication means that users will authenticate against an external LDAP server.\r\n\r\n<i>Note:</i> Authentication settings can be customized on a per user basis.\r\n\r\n<b>LDAP URL (default)</b>\r\nThe default url to your LDAP server. The LDAP URL takes the form of <b>ldap://[server]:[port]/[base DN]</b>. Example: ldap://ldap.mycompany.com:389/o=MyCompany.\r\n\r\n<b>LDAP Identity</b>\r\nThe LDAP Identity is the unique identifier in the LDAP server that the user will be identified against. Often this field is <b>shortname</b>, which takes the form of first initial + last name. Example: jdoe. Therefore if you specify the LDAP identity to be <i>shortname</i> then Jon Doe would enter <i>jdoe</i> during the registration process.\r\n\r\n<b>LDAP Identity Name</b>\r\nThe label used to describe the LDAP Identity to the user. For instance, some companies use an LDAP server for their proxy server users to authenticate against. In the documentation or training already provided to their users, the LDAP identity is known as their <i>Web Username</b>. So you could enter that label here for consitency.\r\n\r\n<b>LDAP Password Name</b>\r\nJust as the LDAP Identity Name is a label, so is the LDAP Password Name. Use this label as you would LDAP Identity Name.\r\n\r\n<b>Session Timeout</b>\r\nThe time (in seconds) that a user session remains active (before needing to log in again). This timeout is reset each time a visitor hits a page. Therefore if you set the timeout for 8 hours, a user would have to log in again if s/he hadn\'t visited the site for 8 hours.\r\n\r\n1800 = half hour\r\n3600 = 1 hour\r\n28000 = 8 hours\r\n86400 = 1 day\r\n604800 = 1 week\r\n1209600 = 2 weeks\r\n\r\n<b>SMTP Server</b>\r\nThis is the address of your local mail server.
