The same is true with WebGUI. Create a page, then add your content to the page.\r\n\r\n<b>Title</b>\r\nThe title of the page is what your users will use to navigate through the site. Titles should be descriptive, but not very long.\r\n\r\n<b>Page URL</b>\r\nWhen you create a page a url for the page is generated based on the page title. If you are unhappy with the url that was chosen, you can change it here.\r\n\r\n<b>Meta Tags</b>\r\nMeta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page. There is a great site called <a href=\"http://www.metatagbuilder.com/\">Meta Tag Builder</a> that will help you build meta tags if you\'ve never done it before.\r\n\r\n<i>Advanced Users:</i> If you have other things (like JavaScript) you usually put in the &lt;head&gt; area of your pages, you may put them here as well.\r\n\r\n<b>Use default meta tags?</b>\r\nIf you don\'t wish to specify meta tags yourself, WebGUI can generate meta tags based on the page title and your company\'s name. Check this box to enable the defaultly generated meta tags.\r\n\r\n<b>Style</b>\r\nBy default, when you create a page, it inherits a few traits from its parent. One of those traits is style. Choose from the list of styles if you would like to change the appearance of this page. See <i>Add Style</i> for more details.\r\n\r\nIf you check the box below to the style pull-down menu, all of the pages below this page will take on the style you\'ve chosen for this page.\r\n\r\n<b>Owner</b>\r\nThe owner of a page is usually the person who created the page.\r\n\r\n<b>Owner can view?</b>\r\nCan the owner view the page or not?\r\n\r\n<b>Owner can edit?</b>\r\nCan the owner edit the page or not? Be careful, if you decide that the owner cannot edit the page and you do not belong to the page group, then you\'ll lose the ability to edit this page.\r\n\r\n<b>Group</b>\r\nA group is assigned to every page for additional privilege control. Pick a group from the pull-down menu.\r\n\r\n<b>Group can view?</b>\r\nCan members of this group view this page?\r\n\r\n<b>Group can edit?</b>\r\nCan members of this group edit this page?\r\n\r\n<b>Anybody can view?</b>\r\nCan any visitor or member regardless of the group and owner view this page?\r\n\r\n<b>Anybody can edit?</b>\r\nCan any visitor or member regardless of the group and owner edit this page?\r\n\r\nYou can optionally give these privileges to all pages under this page.\r\n','0');

Using style management, you have ultimate control over all your designs.\r\n\r\nThere are three styles built in to WebGUI: Fail Safe, Plain Black Software, and Yahoo!&reg;. These styles are not meant to be edited, but rather to give you samples of what\'s possible.\r\n\r\n<b>Fail Safe</b>\r\nWhen you delete a style that is still in use on some pages, the Fail Safe style will be applied to those pages.

The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.\r\n\r\n<b>Registered Users</b>\r\nWhen users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.\r\n\r\n<b>Visitors</b>\r\nVisitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system.
