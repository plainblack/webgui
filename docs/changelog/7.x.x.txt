   strings when given a MySQL Date/Time string as a default value. This is now

   where clause, "join" for making join clauses, and "columns" for adding more
   columns to return.

   strings when given a MySQL Date/Time string as a default value. This is now

   where clause, "join" for making join clauses, and "columns" for adding more
   columns to return.
