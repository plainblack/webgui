It is best if the name is descriptive so you know what it is at a glance.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Description</b><br>\r\nA longer description of the group so that other admins and content managers (or you if you forget) will know what the purpose of this group is.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Expire Offset</b><br>\r\nThe amount of time that a user will belong to this group before s/he is expired (or removed) from it. This is very useful for membership sites where users have certain privileges for a specific period of time. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>NOTE:</b> This can be overridden on a per-user basis.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Notify user about expiration?</b><br>\r\nSet this value to yes if you want WebGUI to contact the user when they are about to be expired from the group.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Expire Notification Offset</b><br>\r\nThe difference in the number of days from the expiration to the notification. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the notification to be sent on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the notification to go out 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the notification to be sent 7 days after the expiration.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Expire Notification Message</b><br>\r\nType the message you wish to be sent to the user telling them about the expiration.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Delete Offset</b><br>\r\nThe difference in the number of days from the expiration to the grouping being deleted from the system. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the grouping to be deleted on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the grouping to be deleted 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the grouping to be deleted 7 days after the expiration.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>IP Address</b><br>\r\nSpecify an IP address or an IP mask to match. If the user\'s IP address matches, they\'ll automatically be included in this group. An IP mask is simply the IP address minus an octet or two. You may also specify multiple IP masks separated by semicolons.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>IP Mask Example:</i> 10.;192.168.;101.42.200.142\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Karma Threshold</b><br>\r\nIf you\'ve enabled Karma, then you\'ll be able to set this value. Karma Threshold is the amount of karma a user must have to be considered part of this group.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Users can add themselves?</b><br>\r\nDo you wish to let users add themselves to this group? See the GroupAdd macro for more info.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Users can remove themselves?</b><br>\r\nDo you wish to let users remove themselves from this group? See the GroupDelete macro for more info.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<i>The following options are recommended only for advanced WebGUI administrators.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Database Link</b><br>\r\nIf you\'d like to have this group validate users using an external database, choose the database link to use.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>SQL Query</b><br>\r\nMany organizations have external databases that map users to groups; for example an HR database might map Employee ID to Health Care Plan.  To validate users against an external database, you need to construct a SQL statement that will return 1 if a user is in the group.  Make sure to begin your statement with "select 1".  You may use macros in this query to access data in a user\'s profile, such as Employee ID.  Here is an example that checks a user against a fictional HR database.  This assumes you have created an additional profile field called employeeId.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nselect 1 from employees, health_plans, empl_plan_map<br>\r\nwhere employees.employee_id = ^User("employeeId");<br>\r\nand health_plans.plan_name = \'HMO 1\'<br>\r\nand employees.employee_id = empl_plan_map.employee_id<br>\r\nand health_plans.health_plan_id = empl_plan_mp.health_plan_id<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis group could then be named "Employees in HMO 1", and would allow you to restrict any page or wobject to only those users who are part of this health plan in the external database.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Cache external groups for how long?</b><br>\r\nLarge sites using external group data will be making many calls to the external database.  To help reduce the load, you may select how long you\'d like to cache the results of the external database query within the WebGUI database.  More advanced background caching may be included in a future version of WebGUI.',1053779630);

Beispiel: ^Execute(\"/verzeichnis/datei.sh\");. \r\n\r\n^FormParam();\r\nDieses Makro wird haupts&auml;chlich benutzt, um dynamische Abfragen in SQL Reports zu erzeugen. Das Benutzen dieses Makros kann z.

Zum Beispiel kann es benutzt werden, um die Seiten-URL anzuzeigen: ^Page(\"urlizedTitle\"); oder um einen Menutitel zu erhalten: ^Page(\"menuTitle\");. \r\n\r\n^SQL();\r\nEin einzeiliger SQL Report. Manchmal ist es erforderlich, schnell einen Datenbankinhalt zur&uuml;ckzugeben. Dieses Makro ist aber auch gut einsetzbar, um einen SQL-Report zu erweitern. Es werden numerische Makros (^0; ^1; ^2; etc) benutz, um Daten zu positionieren. Sie k&ouml;nnen auch das ^rownum; Makro wie beim SQL Report Wobject benutzen.\r\n\r\nBeispiele: \r\n\r\n^SQL(\"select count(*) from users\",\"Es sind ^0; Benutzer registriert.\"); \r\n\r\n^SQL(\"select userId,username from users order by username\",\"<a href=\'^/;?op=viewProfile&uid=^0;\'>^1;</a><br>\"); \r\n\r\n^URLEncode();\r\nDieses Makro wird auch haupts&auml;chlich in SQL Reports verwendet, aber es kann auch genauso gut wo anders eingesetzt werden. Es &uuml;berpr&uuml;ft den Inhalt einer Eingabe (z. B. im Formular) und wandelt ihn in eine URL um, sodass die Eingabe nachher als Link angezeigt wird. Die Syntax ist wie folgt: ^URLEncode(\"Ist dies meine Eingabe?\"); \r\n\r\n^User();\r\nMit diesem Makro k&ouml;nnen Sie einige Infos aus dem Benutzer-Konto oder Benutzerprofil anzeigen lassen. Wenn Sie z. B. die Emailadresse des Benutzers anzeigen m&ouml;chten, m&uuml;ssen Sie das Makro wie folgt verwenden: ^User(\"email\");\r\n\r\n^*; oder ^*(); - Zufallszahl\r\nEine Zufallszahl. Wird oft in Banner-Ads oder &auml;hnlichem ben&ouml;tigt, um z. B. sicherzustellen, das nicht gecachet wird.

Hiermit \r\nhat der Benutzer die M&ouml;glichkeit Daten von allen Datenbanken abzufragen, zu \r\ndenen er Zugriff hat. Damit kann er z. B.

Normalerweise \r\nbenutzt man HTML-Tabellen um einen SQL-Report zu generieren. Wenn Sie dieses \r\nFeld leerlassen, wird eine Vorlage basierend auf der Ergebnisliste angezeigt. \r\n<P>Es gibt einige spezielle Makros-Zeichen die zur Erstellung von SQL-Reports \r\ngenutzt werden k&ouml;nnen. Diese sind \r\n^-;, ^0;, ^1;, ^2;, ^3;, etc. Diese Makros werden ungeachtet der Einstellungen \r\n&quot;Makros in der Abfrage vorverarbeiten&quot; abgearbeitet.  Das  ^- Makro stellt \r\nTrennpunkte im Dokument dar, um zu kennzeichnen, wo die Anfangs- und Endschleife \r\ndes Reports beginnt. Die numerischen Makros stellen die Datenfelder dar, die \r\nvon Ihrer Abfrage zur&uuml;ckgegeben werden. Es gibt noch ein zus&auml;tzliches Makro \r\n(^rownum;), das die Zeilen der Abfrage beginnend bei 1 z&auml;hlt.

You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to \"0\" if you wish the notification to be sent on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to \"-7\" if you want the notification to go out 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to \"7\" if you wish the notification to be sent 7 days after the expiration.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Expire Notification Message</b><br>\r\nType the message you wish to be sent to the user telling them about the expiration.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Delete Offset</b><br>\r\nThe difference in the number of days from the expiration to the grouping being deleted from the system.

Set it to \"7\" if you wish the grouping to be deleted 7 days after the expiration.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Scratch Filter</b><br>\r\nA user can be dynamically bound to a group by a scratch variable in their session. Scratch variables can be set programatically, or via the web. To set a scratch variable via the web, tack the following on to the end of any URL:\r\n<p>\r\n<i>?op=setScratch&scratchName=somename&scratchValue=somevalue</i>\r\n<p>\r\nHaving done that, when a user clicks on that link they will have a scratch variable added to their session with a name of \"www_somename\" and a value of \"somevalue\". The \"www_\" is prepended to prevent web requests from overwriting scratch variables that were set programatically.\r\n<p>\r\nTo set a scratch filter simply add a line to the scratch filter field that looks like:\r\n<p>\r\n<i>www_somename=somevalue</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>IP Address</b><br>\r\nSpecify an IP address or an IP mask to match. If the user\'s IP address matches, they\'ll automatically be included in this group. An IP mask is simply the IP address minus an octet or two. You may also specify multiple IP masks separated by semicolons.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>IP Mask Example:</i> 10.;192.168.;101.42.200.142\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Karma Threshold</b><br>\r\nIf you\'ve enabled Karma, then you\'ll be able to set this value. Karma Threshold is the amount of karma a user must have to be considered part of this group.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Users can add themselves?</b><br>\r\nDo you wish to let users add themselves to this group?

See the GroupDelete macro for more info.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<i>The following options are recommended only for advanced WebGUI administrators.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Database Link</b><br>\r\nIf you\'d like to have this group validate users using an external database, choose the database link to use.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>SQL Query</b><br>\r\nMany organizations have external databases that map users to groups; for example an HR database might map Employee ID to Health Care Plan.  To validate users against an external database, you need to construct a SQL statement that will return 1 if a user is in the group.  Make sure to begin your statement with \"select 1\".  You may use macros in this query to access data in a user\'s profile, such as Employee ID.  Here is an example that checks a user against a fictional HR database.  This assumes you have created an additional profile field called employeeId.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nselect 1 from employees, health_plans, empl_plan_map<br>\r\nwhere employees.employee_id = ^User(\"employeeId\");<br>\r\nand health_plans.plan_name = \'HMO 1\'<br>\r\nand employees.employee_id = empl_plan_map.employee_id<br>\r\nand health_plans.health_plan_id = empl_plan_mp.health_plan_id<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis group could then be named \"Employees in HMO 1\", and would allow you to restrict any page or wobject to only those users who are part of this health plan in the external database.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Cache external groups for how long?</b><br>\r\nLarge sites using external group data will be making many calls to the external database.  To help reduce the load, you may select how long you\'d like to cache the results of the external database query within the WebGUI database.  More advanced background caching may be included in a future version of WebGUI.', 1066651479,NULL);
