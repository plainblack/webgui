However, by specifying a template other than the default you can sub-divide the content area into several sections.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Synopsis</b><br>\r\nA short description of a page. It is used to populate default descriptive meta tags as well as to provide descriptions on Site Maps.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Meta Tags</b><br>\r\nMeta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page.

Be careful, if you decide that the owner cannot edit the page and you do not belong to the page group, then you\'ll lose the ability to edit this page.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Group</b><br>\r\nA group is assigned to every page for additional privilege control.
