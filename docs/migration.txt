WebGUI 8 Migration Guide
------------------------

The information contained herein documents the API changes that have occurred
in the WebGUI 8 development effort and how to migrate your code to accomodate
the new APIs.

WebGUI::Auth
==========================

The API for new() has changed: new( $session, $userId );

editUserSettingsForm deprecated. Use editSettingsForm
editUserSettingsFormSave is deprecated. Use editSettingsFormSave
editUserForm and editSettingsForm now return WebGUI::FormBuilder objects instead of raw HTML.
deleteParams is deprecated. use delete()
deleteSingleParam is deprecated. use delete("param")
saveParams is deprecated. use update()
getParams is deprecated. use get()
init() is deprecated. Use www_view()
isAdmin, isVisitor, isRegistered are all deprecated. use user->is* instead
setCallable and isCallable are deprecated. use www_ prefix instead.

WebGUI::User
==========================

updateProfileFields is deprecated. Use update
profileField is deprecated. Use get() and update()
authInstance is deprecated. Instead instantiate the auth method and give it a
    user or userId

WebGUI::Macro::AdminBar
==========================
There is no Admin Bar for normal pages. Only the admin mode can see the admin bar.

WebGUI::Macro::AdminToggle
==========================
The Admin Toggle can only enter admin mode, it cannot leave it, so there is no "Turn Off" text. The second 
parameter is now the template ID.


WebGUI::Config
==============
WebGUI::Config->new has a new API.  Its WebGUI root parameter has been
eliminated.  It now only accepts a config file as either an absolute path, or
a path relative to WebGUI's etc directory.

my $config = WebGUI::Config->new($filename);



WebGUI::Session
===============
WebGUI::Session->open has a new API.  Its WebGUI root parameter has been
eliminated.  The config file it is given can be either an absolute path, or a
path relative to WebGUI's etc directory.

my $session = WebGUI::Session->open($configFile);

perldoc WebGUI::Session for more details about the arguments.


WebGUI::Session::Env
====================
WebGUI::Session::Env has been moved into WebGUI::Session::Request.  A listing
of replacements and equivalents follows:

$session->env->getIp => $session->request->address

WebGUI::Session::ErrorHandler
=============================

ErrorHandler has been changed to "log" in all circumstances. $session->errorHandler no longer exists,
use $session->log. WebGUI::Session::ErrorHandler no longer exists, use WebGUI::Session::Log

WebGUI::Utility
===============
This module has been removed.  It had many functions that weren't used, and others have better replacements.

    formatBytes       -> Number::Format::format_bytes
    commify           -> Number::Format::format_number
    emailRegex        -> Email::Valid->address()
    isBetween         -> <= / >=
    makeArrayTabSafe  -> Text::CSV_XS methods
    scalarEquals      -> eq
    randint           -> int( rand( $x ) )
    isInSubnet        -> Net::CIDR::Lite->new(@filters)->find($ip)
    round             -> sprintf '%.0f', $x
    isIn              -> smart match
    sortHash          -> sort with map

All other subs were unused and were just removed.


WebGUI::Cache
=============
WebGUI::Cache has been completely rewritten. If you were using the cache API
in the past, you'll need to update your code to reflect the changes. NOTE: you
can get a cached reference to the cache object from WebGUI::Session, which
will be substantially faster than instantiating the object yourself.

my $cache = $session->cache;



WebGUI::Asset 
============= 
The Asset API has been changed in small, but
significant ways. You'll need to make a few changes to your asset subclasses
to support these changes.

Definition 
----------
You must migrate your asset to use the new
WebGUI::Definition::Asset class instead of the definition() method. This
executes several orders of magnitude faster, but is different in a few ways.

1) You define your definition using property and define calls, as well as
standard Moose syntax.

2) You no longer have a reference to $session, so you'll need to make sub
routine refs to to method calls. However, you cannot use sub refs on any
attributes or the following property elements: tableName.

3) You no longer have the "customDrawMethod" element. You must make custom
form controls.

4) You no longer have filters. Instead, each property has a method called
propertyName (so a property called 'title' would be title()). You can override
that to achieve the same result.  You can see examples of this in Asset.pm,
look at the url and title properties.

5) Because you don't have a reference to $session, you can't internationalize
right in the definition. So property elements like "label" and "hoverHelp" are
just i18n identifiers and will automatically be run through
internationalization on calling the getFormProperties() method.  To specify an
i18n identifier, place the label and namespace in an arrayref, like this:
    
    label => ['i18n key', 'namespace'],

6) Definition's are now rigid. This means that every property needs to be
defined in the definition, and it must at least have a "fieldType" element. If
the field is to be displayed (ie: it doesn't have a noFormPost=>1 element)
then it must also at minimum have label elements. In addition, you must
specify assetName, tableName, and properties defines at minimum. Anything less
is invalid. 

7) The properties attribute must be an array reference of properties. No more
Tie::IxHash.

8) The autoGenerateForms has been removed. All edit forms are autogenerated in
WebGUI 8.

9) You no longer have the "visible" element. It was a duplicate of
"noFormPost", so use "noFormPost" instead.

10) You no longer have the "displayOnly" element. Make a custom form control
instead.

11) Defaults for properties are set by the default key in the property.  This
sets form defaults as well.  This means that newly created Assets always have
sane defaults.  Unless specifically overridden, any property can be set to
undef.  This takes care of the long standing problem with sticky titles and
other fields.

12) You no longer have the "allowEmpty" element. However, you can now specify
an initial value in the "value" element, and set "default" to undef if you
want to have an initial value but allow the field to become empty or undef.

Here's an example.

use WebGUI::Definition::Asset;
extends 'WebGUI::Asset';
define assetName  => 'Gadget';
define tableName  => 'gadget'; 
define uiLevel    => 5;
define icon       => 'gadget.gif';
property urlToJavascript => (
            fieldType    => 'url',
            label        => ['URL to Javascript Class','Asset_Gadget'],
            hoverHelp    => ['URL to Javascript Class help','Asset_Gadget'],
         );
property foo => (
            fieldType    => 'text',
            noFormPost   => 1,
         );
property bar => (
            fieldType    => 'codearea',
            uiLevel      => 9,
            label        => ['Bar','Asset_Gadget'],
            hoverHelp    => ['Bar help','Asset_Gadget'],
            builder      => '_bar_builder',  ##Set default using Moose's builder and lazy method
            lazy         => 1,
         );
sub _bar_builder {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->callSomeMethod;
}
property baz => (
            fieldType    => 'checkboxList',
            label        => ['Baz','Asset_Gadget'],
            hoverHelp    => ['Baz help','Asset_Gadget'],
            default      => 1,
            options      => \&_baz_options, ##method called when getFormProperties called, automatically lazy
         );
sub _baz_options {
    my ($self, $property_meta_object, $property_name) = @_;
    my $session = $self->session;
    my $i18n    = WebGUI::International->new($session, 'Asset_Gadget');
    tie my %options, 'Tie::IxHash';
    %options = (
        one   => $i18n->get('one'),
        two   => $i18n->get('two'),
        three => $i18n->get('three'),
    );
    return \%options;
}

Asset Instanciators
-------------------
Moose does not allow a dynamic class to be passed into ->new.  Trying to
access an asset from the database like this:

    WebGUI::Asset->new($session, $assetId, 'WebGUI::Asset::Template');

will give you back an object with class WebGUI::Asset, with some of the data from the Template.

You have two options to deal with this:

1) Brute force method

my $class = WebGUI::Asset->loadModule($asset_module_name);
my $asset = $class->new($session, $assetId);

2) Use newById

newById replaces the older, and longer, newByDynamicClass method.

my $asset = WebGUI::Asset->newById($session, $assetId);

->new itself will either lookup an asset in the database and return you an object, or build you
an object without storing the data into the database, depending on how it's called.

WebGUI::Asset::SomeClass->new($session, $assetId, $revisionDate)  will try to look up the requested object
of type SomeClass, populated with information from the database.

WebGUI::Asset::SomeClass->new($propertyHashRef) will return you an object of type SomeClass populated
with the properties you have passed in.  Missing properties will have default set from the definition.

Exceptions
----------
All Asset instanciators, new, newById, newByUrl, newPending, newByPropertyHashRef throw exceptions instead
of returning undef to indicate an error.  You should wrap any call to an instanciator in an eval, and catch
any exceptions that are thrown and deal with them.

my $asset = eval { WebGUI::Asset->newById($session, $assetId); };
if (my $exception = Exception::Class->caught() ) {
    ##Log or handle the exception.  Exceptions can also be rethrown to be passed farther up the call chain.
}

Removed Methods
---------------
assetDbProperties - Simply instanciate the asset if you want it's properties.

assetExists - Simply instanciate the asset if you want to know if it exists.

getValue - Use get() or the individual property accessors instead.

fixTitle - The title() method does what this used to do as the title is set.

fixUrlFromParent - This functionality is built into fixUrl, so that all fixes happen and can't cause breakages.

fixId - Never assign the asset anything other than a GUID.

Asset API
----------
->get will still work, but will be slightly slower since inside it calls the direct Moose accessor.  Similarly,
getId is slightly slower than ->assetId.

processPropertiesFromFormPost
-----------------------------
Absurdly long and non-descriptive name, changed to processEditForm

Admin Controls
--------------------
The admin controls are now added to the asset with javascript. This javascript
is located in www/extras/admin/toolbar.js

Turn Admin On
--------------------
There is no Turn Admin On. In order to maintain some backwards compatibility, 
if you are a member of the Turn Admin On group, "Admin On" will be set when you
log in.

www_add/www_edit
--------------------
www_add is now its own page, it is no longer handled by www_edit. www_addSave
is also its own page, it is no longer handled by www_addSave.

If you had previously overrode www_edit to provide a template, you must move
that code into an overridden getEditTemplate.  See WebGUI::Asset::Event,
WebGUI::Asset::Post, WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::GalleryAlbum for examples.

Lineage
--------------------
Assets created for use during www_add do NOT have a lineage.  Calling
getLineage on them will return assets from below the root asset, and not
the child.  See WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::GalleryAlbum::getFileIds.

WebGUI::Shop::Vendor
====================
Object properties are no longer written to the database when an object is
created from scratch.  The write method needs to be called.

WebGUI::Shop::AddressBook
=========================
Since create is now really new, there is no way to create an address book for
an arbitrary userId.  To work around this, update the address book with the
new userId after it has been created.

WebGUI::Shop::PayDriver
=======================
getEditForm now returns a WebGUI::FormBuilder object

WebGUI::Shop::ShipDriver
========================
getEditForm now returns a WebGUI::FormBuilder object

WebGUI::Shop::TaxDriver
=======================
getConfigurationScreen is now called getEditForm and should return a WebGUI::FormBuilder object

WebGUI::Shop::Address
=====================
Object properties are no longer written to the database when an object is
created from scratch.  The write method needs to be called.

WebGUI::Shop::Transaction
=========================
Object properties are no longer written to the database when an object is
created from scratch.  The write method needs to be called.

WebGUI::Shop::TransactionItem
=============================
Object properties are no longer written to the database when an object is
created from scratch.  The write method needs to be called.

WebGUI::Shop::CartItem
=============================
Object properties are no longer written to the database when an object is
created from scratch.  The write method needs to be called.

Inventory adjust is also no longer done when an object is created from
scratch.  You will need to call onAdjustQuantityInCart manually.

WebGUI::URL
==========================
In WebGUI 8, URL handlers are now done as Plack middleware.  See
WebGUI::Middleware::Snoop and WebGUI::Middleware::WGAccess for examples.

WebGUI::Session::Var
==========================
WebGUI::Session::Var was removed, and all of its code merged into
WebGUI::Session.  Any call that used to be made to $session->var should now go
directly to $session.

WebGUI::Session::Http
==========================
getStatus and setStatus have been removed.  To set or get the status of an HTTP response
generated by WebGUI, access the WebGUI::Response object in the session:

OLD: $session->http->getStatus();
NEW: $session->response->status();

OLD: $session->http->setStatus(200);
NEW: $session->response->status(200);

getMimeType and setMimeType have been removed.  To set or get the content type of an HTTP response
generated by WebGUI, access the WebGUI::Response object in the session:

OLD: $session->http->getMimeType();
NEW: $session->response->content_type();

OLD: $session->http->setMimeType('application/json');
NEW: $session->response->content_type('application/json');

getFilename and setFilename have been removed.  To set the filename that should be
uploaded to the user, access the WebGUI::Response object in the session.  First, set
the header for the Content-Dispostion, then set the content type.

OLD: $session->http->setFilename($filename);
NEW: $session->response->header( 'Content-Disposition' => qq{attachment; filename="}.$filename.'"');
     $session->response->content_type('application/octet-stream');

getRedirectLocation and setRedirectLocation have been removed.  These methods were not
used outside of WebGUI::Session::Http, but were designed for object encapsulation
inside the object.  If you need to directly set or access the redirect location,
use the location mutator in the WebGUI::Response object in the session.

OLD: $session->http->setRedirectLocation($url);
NEW: $session->response->location($url);

OLD: $session->http->getRedirectLocation();
NEW: $session->response->location();

ifModifiedSince was moved from WebGUI::Session::Http to WebGUI::Session::Request.

OLD: $session->http->ifModifiedSince;
NEW: $session->request->ifModifiedSince;

WebGUI::Workflow::Activity
==========================
getEditForm now returns a WebGUI::FormBuilder object
